Project Overview

This project involves developing a premium, secure, and
user-friendly real estate platform with two key interfaces: an
Admin Dashboard and an Agent Portal. The Admin side allows
the super admin and content managers to create and manage
property listings, upload media, assign properties to agents, and
control access with robust role-based permissions. It also supports
bulk uploads, SEO optimization, and secure audit logging. The
Agent Portal is designed for ease of use, giving agents quick
access to assigned properties, with features to copy descriptions,
copy calendar links, and download images or complete marketing
packs in one click.
The system ensures smooth collaboration, fast content
distribution, and a professional experience aligned with premium
real estate standards.
